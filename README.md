# Spatial Metal 

![Example screenshot](Screenshots/Screenshot.png)

Rendering two metal shaders in immersive space: Earth and Stars, which represent foreground and background. 

A fork of this project to allow for multiple uniform eye buffers is [here](https://github.com/musesum/SpatialMetal2)

Started as a port of C++ version by Warren Moore, [here](https://github.com/metal-by-example/metal-spatial-rendering)

Refactored to align with XCode Template: 
    ```
    File >> New Project >> visionOS >> App >> Window,Metal,Full
    ```
    
There was a previous iteration of this project that worked on a simulator but was missing key elements. This iteration is more likely to work, but not verified.
